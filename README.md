https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c470f4b-1513-4f22-bab9-051ee4adda49


This project is a command-line-based scientific calculator implemented in C++, designed to handle a variety of mathematical operations. The calculator provides functionalities for solving common mathematical problems, including equations, vector operations, and matrix computations.

## Features

- **Power Calculation**:
Compute the n-th power of a given number.

- **Slope Calculation**:
Determine the slope of a line using two given points (x1,y1)(x1â€‹,y1â€‹) and (x2,y2)(x2â€‹,y2â€‹).

- **Quadratic Equation Solver (Real Roots)**:
Solve quadratic equations with real roots.

- **Quadratic Equation Solver (Complex Roots)**:
Solve quadratic equations with complex roots.

- **Cross Product of Vectors**:
Calculate the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors.

- **Matrix Symmetry Checker**:
Check whether a square matrix (nÃ—nnÃ—n) is symmetric.
Maximum matrix size: 4Ã—4.

- **System of Linear Equations Solver**:
Solve systems of equations with 3 variables using methods like substitution or matrix manipulation (uses Cramer's rule).

- **Tabulation of Linear or Quadratic Functions**:
Save a table of points for a linear or quadratic function into a .txt file, based on a specified interval and step size.

## Usage

The program runs interactively in the terminal.
Users can select the desired operation from a menu and provide the required inputs for each functionality.

## Technologies/ Used

- **C++**: The core programming language for implementing mathematical computations and user interaction.
- **File Handling**: Write and save tabulated points for functions to .txt files.
